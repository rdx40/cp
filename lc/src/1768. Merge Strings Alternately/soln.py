            if i < len(word1):

## O(n+m) where n and m is len of the words 
## O(n+m) space where n+m is len of result string
## string concatenation with += is not optimal for performance on longer strings. Each += on a string creates a new copy of the string (since strings are immutable in Python), so the operation ends up being O(nÂ²) in time if the strings are long.
